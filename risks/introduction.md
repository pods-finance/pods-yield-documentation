# Introduction

Investing in any asset or strategy comes with risks, both in TradiFi and in DeFi. In this section, we analyze and classify different sources of risk that may impact funds allocated in our vault.&#x20;

Currently, funds invested in our protocol have exposure to at least 3 different protocols: Pods Vault, Lido, and Ethereum Mainnet.&#x20;

Each exposure has different probabilities of an event happening; if they do occur, they will impact the vault with different intensities.&#x20;

The following sections will explain how we analyze each exposure, attribute the likelihood of events, and score the impacts of potential events.
