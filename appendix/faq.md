# FAQ

## What are options? <a href="#eef2" id="eef2"></a>

An option is an agreement between two parties: a seller and a buyer. The seller writes the contract terms and sells them to the buyer for a premium. That means the seller now has an obligation, and the buyer has a right (but not an obligation) to exercise the contract terms upon expiration.

## **What types of options are there?** <a href="#ec54" id="ec54"></a>

There are two basic types of options: puts and calls. A put represents the right to **sell** the underlying asset at the strike price. On the other hand, a call conveys the right to **buy** an asset at the strike price.

## What is a strangle? <a href="#e318" id="e318"></a>

A strangle is an options strategy in which the investor holds a position in both a [call](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/call.asp) and a [put](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/put.asp) option with different [strike prices](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/strikeprice.asp), but with the same expiration date and underlying asset. A strangle is a good strategy if you think the underlying security will experience a large price movement in the near future but are unsure of the direction. However, it is profitable mainly if the asset does swing sharply in price.

## What is the strike price? <a href="#2f53" id="2f53"></a>

The strike price is commonly used to designate the price at which the underlying asset will be sold or bought in the future.
