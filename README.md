# Introduction to Pods Yield

Pods Yield is a 1-click-deposit investment product.  It makes it easy to invest in complex derivatives strategies. In traditional finance, it is similar to a structured product.

Pods Yieldâ€™s first strategy is called **stETHvv** (Eth Volatility Vault). stETHvv is a **principal protected** (You never withdraw less than you initially started), **low-risk strategy** focused on **ETH accumulation.**&#x20;

For the principal protected strategy, we have a hybrid on-chain/off-chain model, where we offer the best of the two worlds: on-chain security with off-chain pricing and liquidity. The principal stays on-chain, and part of the weekly yield is sent to the controller who can access off-chain opportunities.



Find out more about stETHvv and its implementation in the following sections.
